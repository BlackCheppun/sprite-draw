# sprite-draw
easy new pygame game, the sqrite (square) leaves traces on the screen and if u click on "space" the sprite will change colors, additionnaly if u click on "s", the game will take a screen shot and will save it on ur main folder. PS: as always u need pygame installed :)

Forgot to add but to control the sprite u will need to use ur arrow keys, have fun :).
